# Linux-Calculator

In this assignment, you are going to study lexical and syntactic analysis part of a compiler. You will use lex and yacc tools in Linux environment. 
Tools such as yacc (or bison) can generate a parser that recognizes valid strings in given language generated by an input grammar. Thus, yacc is referred to as a parser generator. The name yacc is an acronym for Yet Another Compiler Compiler. A compiler compiler is a tool that is used to build compilers. Yacc is a bottom-up type parser. The input to the parser generated by yacc is almost always the lexemes that are produced by the scanner generated by lex. In fact, lex and yacc are so frequently used together that lots of people forget that they can be used independently. Yacc takes as input a grammar that you specify and generates a parser that recognizes valid “sentences” in that grammar. 
The specification for yacc is provided in a file that by convention has .y as its extension. The structure of the file containing the specification for yacc is very similar to the structure of the file containing the specification for lex. This is because the file structure of lex was patterned after the file structure of yacc.
