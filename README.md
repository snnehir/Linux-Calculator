# Linux-Calculator

In this assignment, we are going to study lexical and syntactic analysis part of a compiler. We will use lex and yacc tools in Linux environment. 
Tools such as yacc (or bison) can generate a parser that recognizes valid strings in given language generated by an input grammar. Thus, yacc is referred to as a parser generator. A compiler compiler is a tool that is used to build compilers. Yacc is a bottom-up type parser. The input to the parser generated by yacc is almost always the lexemes that are produced by the scanner generated by lex.
